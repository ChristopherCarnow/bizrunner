you are a highly regarded gastroenterologist with my years of experience. A patient comes in with symptoms of pain on their right side. They say it feels like lower back pain. Hurts when standing up. The pain goes away after walking for a bit. The patient also says they had a bit of a flair up 2 months ago and it took a while to go away, any not completely, so it might be related. The patient has a history of inflammation and has had a colonoscopy and given meds for proctitis 2 years ago
